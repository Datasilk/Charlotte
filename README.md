# Charlotte
An off-screen Chromium web browser used to extract the computed DOM from any web page using .NET Core WCF.


##### Why Charlotte?
Named after the spider in the children's story "Charlotte's Web". Charlotte prevented the slaughter of a piglette named Wilbur by weaving words of praise for Wilbur into her web, which in turn surprised the local farmers and convinced them to keep Wilbur alive.

Similarly, the Charlotte console app weaves a JSON object from the computed DOM of a web page, so that developers can keep the contents of an article instead of letting it go to the slaughter (when the publisher of an article decides to archive the URL).
